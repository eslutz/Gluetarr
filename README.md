A lightweight, production-ready Go application that automatically synchronizes port forwarding changes from Gluetun VPN to qBittorrent. Built with observability and reliability in mind.

## Features

- **Automatic Port Synchronization**: Monitors Gluetun's forwarded port file and updates qBittorrent instantly
- **Webhook Notifications**: Send HTTP POST notifications when port changes occur for external integrations
- **Full Observability**: Prometheus metrics for monitoring and alerting
- **Health & Readiness**: Kubernetes-compatible health check endpoints
- **Efficient File Watching**: Uses fsnotify for real-time file system events
- **Secure by Default**: Runs as non-root user in Docker, minimal attack surface
- **Lightweight**: ~15MB Docker image, minimal resource footprint
- **Production Ready**: Automatic re-authentication, graceful error handling, fallback polling

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose

An example `docker-compose.yml` file is available at [docker-compose.example.yml](docker-compose.example.yml).

### Docker CLI

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name forwardarr \
  -e GLUETUN_PORT_FILE=/tmp/gluetun/forwarded_port \
  -e TORRENT_CLIENT_URL=http://qbittorrent:8080 \
  -e TORRENT_CLIENT_USER=admin \
  -e TORRENT_CLIENT_PASSWORD=adminadmin \
  -v gluetun-data:/tmp/gluetun:ro \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  ghcr.io/eslutz/forwardarr:latest

## Architecture

```txt
┌─────────┐         ┌──────────┐         ┌────────────┐
│ Gluetun │ writes  │  Port    │ watched │            │
│   VPN   ├────────►│   File   ├────────►│ Forwardarr │
└─────────┘         └──────────┘         └─────┬──────┘
                                                │
                                                │ updates
                                                ▼
                                         ┌─────────────┐
                                         │ qBittorrent │
                                         └─────────────┘
```

**How it works:**

1. Gluetun establishes a VPN connection with port forwarding
2. Gluetun writes the forwarded port to a file
3. Forwardarr watches this file for changes using fsnotify
4. When the port changes, Forwardarr updates qBittorrent's listening port via API
5. A fallback ticker ensures sync even if file events are missed (configurable, can be disabled)

## Webhooks

Forwardarr can send HTTP POST notifications when port changes occur. This is useful for integrating with other services or triggering automation workflows.

### Webhook Configuration

Configure webhooks via environment variables:

```bash
WEBHOOK_URL=http://your-server.com/webhook
WEBHOOK_TEMPLATE=json  # Options: json, discord, slack, gotify
WEBHOOK_EVENTS=port_changed  # Comma-separated event list
WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT=10  # Timeout in seconds
```

### Webhook Templates

Forwardarr supports multiple webhook formats:

**JSON (default)** - Generic JSON payload
```json
{
  "event": "port_changed",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-08T12:00:00Z",
  "old_port": 8080,
  "new_port": 9090,
  "message": "Port changed from 8080 to 9090"
}
```

**Discord** - Formatted for Discord webhooks with embeds
```bash
WEBHOOK_TEMPLATE=discord
WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK
```

**Slack** - Formatted for Slack webhooks with blocks
```bash
WEBHOOK_TEMPLATE=slack
WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR_WEBHOOK
```

**Gotify** - Formatted for Gotify push notifications
```bash
WEBHOOK_TEMPLATE=gotify
WEBHOOK_URL=https://gotify.example.com/message?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Event Filtering

Control which events trigger webhooks using `WEBHOOK_EVENTS`:

```bash
WEBHOOK_EVENTS=port_changed          # Only port changes (default)
```

**Currently supported events:**
- `port_changed` - Triggered when the forwarded port is successfully updated in qBittorrent

**Note:** Currently, `port_changed` is the only event type available. The event filtering system is designed for extensibility, allowing additional events to be added in future releases (such as `sync_error`, `startup`, or `shutdown`).

### Webhook Security

- Webhooks are sent with `Content-Type: application/json`
- User-Agent is set to `Forwardarr-Webhook/1.0`
- Consider using HTTPS URLs for webhook endpoints
- Implement signature verification on your webhook receiver if needed
- Webhook failures are logged but do not prevent port updates

## HTTP Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Response |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `GET /health` | Liveness probe | `200 OK` if running |
| `GET /ready` | Readiness probe | `200 OK` if qBittorrent is reachable |
| `GET /status` | Full diagnostics | JSON status object |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus metrics | Metrics in OpenMetrics format |

### Endpoint Usage

- **/health**: Configure this as a **Liveness Probe**. It indicates if the Forwardarr process is running. If this fails, the container should be restarted.
- **/ready**: Configure this as a **Readiness Probe**. It indicates if Forwardarr can successfully communicate with qBittorrent. If this fails, the container should remain running but not receive traffic/work until the dependency recovers.
- **/status**: Use this for manual debugging or external monitoring dashboards. It provides a JSON snapshot of the application's internal state, including version and connectivity status.
- **/metrics**: Configure your Prometheus scraper to target this endpoint to collect application performance data.

## Prometheus Metrics

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `forwardarr_info` | Gauge | Build information (version, commit, date) |
| `forwardarr_current_port` | Gauge | Current forwarded port from Gluetun |
| `forwardarr_sync_total` | Counter | Total number of successful port syncs |
| `forwardarr_sync_errors` | Counter | Total number of failed sync attempts |
| `forwardarr_last_sync_timestamp` | Gauge | Unix timestamp of last successful sync |

### Example Prometheus Queries

```promql
# Current forwarded port
forwardarr_current_port

# Sync success rate (last 5m)
rate(forwardarr_sync_total[5m]) / (rate(forwardarr_sync_total[5m]) + rate(forwardarr_sync_errors[5m]))

# Time since last successful sync
time() - forwardarr_last_sync_timestamp
```

## Grafana Dashboard

A pre-built Grafana dashboard is available at [docs/dashboard.json](docs/dashboard.json). Import it into your Grafana instance to visualize:

- Application version and build info
- Current forwarded port with change history
- Sync operation success rates and error counts
- Go runtime metrics (memory, goroutines, CPU)
- Time since last successful sync

## Troubleshooting

### Forwardarr can't connect to qBittorrent

- Verify qBittorrent is accessible at the configured address
- Check credentials are correct
- Ensure network connectivity between containers
- Check logs: `docker logs forwardarr`

### Port not updating

- Verify Gluetun is writing to the port file: `cat /tmp/gluetun/forwarded_port`
- Check the port file path is correct in Forwardarr config
- Ensure the volume mount is working: `docker exec forwardarr cat /tmp/gluetun/forwarded_port`
- Increase log level to debug: `LOG_LEVEL=debug`

### High resource usage

- Increase `SYNC_INTERVAL` to reduce polling frequency
- Check for excessive file system events in the watched directory
